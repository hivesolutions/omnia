# Omni Address Book

A simple Omni API application that displays the complete set of customers and suppliers
for the company associated with the API consumer. The current implementation uses both
the [UXF](https://github.com/hivesolutions/uxf) and [Flask Quorum](https://github.com/hivesolutions/flask_quorum) frameworks.
